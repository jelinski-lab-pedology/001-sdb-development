This folder will include every controlled vocabulary csv file.

Information stored here must be in a machine-readable (.csv) format.

contains:

- tablename-fieldname.csv (many of these)
    + every controlled vocab is structured the same way, but we need to know the overlapping column names (like human readable, sdb iid,)
    + funky iids sdb:
    + term_code = machine readable
    + pref_label = human readable
    + alt _labels = synonyms
    + definition = human readable definition
    + status = accepted/retired 
    + created/modfified
    + exact match: exact reference
    + clost match: close to what we're using
    + source

- units.csv
    + unit level
        - controlled vocabulary 

Note: cutoff for controlled vocabularies included in html was 15 values
ex:
- sample texture has >15 values, so the controlled vocabulary pulls from a table in sdb
- moist consistence has <15 values, so the controlled vocabulary is created through code within the html
