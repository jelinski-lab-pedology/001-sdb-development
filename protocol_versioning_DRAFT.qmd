# Protocol versioning ideas draft

## Protocol versioning system: semantic versioning

Semantic versioning is a 3-part version number:
- major.minor.patch (ex: 2.1.3)

It context of protocol creation and updates:

#### Major

The creation of a protocol, or anything that significantly changes how a procedure is executed
- creating a protocol
- translating a protocol from one format to another (print to markdown/ebook)
- adding steps
- reworking step order

#### Minor

Adding (or replacing) information to aid in protocol clarity
- adding or replacing photos/videos
- adding notes to already existent steps

#### Patch

Very minor edits that do not change the information provided within the protocol at large
- fixing typos
- editing spacing
- resizing photos
- reqording small sections to improve readability

## Protocol Standardization

### Protocols generally serve to:

- Provide enough information to get started executing a protocol accurately when training is not available
    + photos, videos showing/explaining specific steps help a lot with this
- Be an aid/supplemental information for those getting trained on a specific procedure
- explain (and cite):
    + what the procedure does (how it works, to some extent)
    + why it's performed/useful
    + where the procedure comes from (external or within the lab)
- describe potential errors (human or machine), and how to troubleshoot them
- be clear, concise, and easily understandable
- generally: help create solid, repeatable science

### Each protocol within our lab needs:

1. standardized name and version number
2. photos and/or screenshots and/or videos
3. citations/credit for:
    + protocol's origin
    + authos, contributors, editors
    + information describing how the procedure works
    + information on why the procedure is useful/performed
4. A standardized order of information

## Standardized order of information within each protocol:

### Introduction

### Timeline (if multi-day)

### Procedure

#### Descriptive/in-depth procedure

#### Abbreviated procedure (do not worry about yet)

### Calculations/exporting process

### Equipment maintanance/troubleshooting
